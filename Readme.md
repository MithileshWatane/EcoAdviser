# EcoAdviser – AI Powered Circular Economy Advisor

EcoAdviser is an AI-powered platform designed to help industries make smarter decisions about waste management by recommending the best end-of-life strategy for materials. It leverages **machine learning, material science, and impact analysis** to promote sustainability, reduce costs, and accelerate the transition toward a **circular economy**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Every day, companies generate tons of waste but lack smart tools to determine whether to:

* **Reuse** – use material again,
* **Recycle** – process into raw material,
* **Upcycle** – convert into higher-value products, or
* **Dispose** responsibly.

This inefficiency leads to:

* Loss of valuable resources,
* Higher costs in waste handling, and
* Increased carbon emissions, harming the environment.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

EcoAdviser is a **ML-powered system** that:

* Classifies waste materials using text/image input,
* Recommends the best end-of-life strategy (reuse, recycle, upcycle, dispose),
* Integrates **economic viability** (market demand & cost analysis),
* Calculates **carbon footprint reduction**, and
* Provides actionable insights via an **interactive dashboard**.
